release 0.24
  - bed verification
  - fix for fluidigm_request

release 0.23
  - fixes for cherrypick_volume

release 0.22
  - Adding a utility class (clarity_elements_fetcher) to update fields on resources more easily.
  - fluidigm_request_volume added
  - cherrypick_volume added

release 0.21
  - bug fix in 1:N stamping - for each input analyte, take into accout
      potential multiple output analytes

release 0.20
  - bug fix - restore copying sapplier name to an udf field

release 0.19
  - version from git describe command - ensure starts with a number
  - sample_received callback bug fix - sample details should only
      be updated once
  - volume check callback tests - capture warnings to keep test optput
      clean
  - stamping callback - do not skip controls that are already on a plate

release 0.18
  - qc_complete added.
  - plate_purpose added.
  - CI: Travis configured.

      ignore input controls and their containers
      a bug in setting container type from container type name is fixed
      stamping from one to multiple plates, optionally of different type;
        container type name should be specified explicitly as many times
        as the number of output containers required; works only for a
        single input container

release 0.17
  - Try:Tiny was breaking the Build. Fixed to Try::Tiny.

  - wtsi_clarity::epp::sm::create_label refactored to use
      wtsi_clarity::util::clarity_elements role to create and update xml elements
  - remove line feeds from error - may be Clarity will display the whole error
      message

release 0.15
  - stamp callback - use of placement url

release 0.14
  - callback for 'stamp' action with an additional option (step_url)

release 0.13
  - empty callback for 'stamp' action

release 0.12
  - explicit increment_purpose flag for create_label callback since it's possible
    that multiple outputs are due to multiple inputs

release 0.11
  - do not overwrite existing plate purpose (preset at cherry-picking stage)

release 0.10
  - add suffix to plate purpose if multiple outputs
  - exclude controls from plate signature generation

release 0.9
  - short signatures pick up the header of the compressed string - change to using md5
